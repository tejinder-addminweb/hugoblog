In today's competitive landscape, digital marketing has become the lifeblood of businesses, especially startups. Having launched a full-funnel marketing agency, I had the unique opportunity to help a roofing startup skyrocket from zero revenue to an impressive $2.2 million in just 18 months. Interestingly, despite this massive success, my earnings were less than a part-time fast-food worker. Here’s how I navigated this journey and why I’m reconsidering the agency model.

## Building a Turnkey Marketing Department

When I first met my roofing client, they were two passionate individuals eager to break free from their jobs and start their own venture. They had no branding, no website, and no digital presence. I essentially became their marketing department, handling everything from lead generation to digital strategies. Here’s what I focused on:

1. **Branding and Website Development**: I created a strong brand identity and a user-friendly website with optimized landing pages.
2. **Ad Strategies**: Implemented Google Ads and Meta Ads to maximize visibility and attract high-intent customers.
3. **CRM Setup and Management**: Established a robust Customer Relationship Management system to track leads and automate processes.
4. **Analytics and Reporting**: Developed full-funnel analytics to monitor performance and make data-driven decisions.
5. **Social Media Management**: Managed their presence on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok with consistent content.

### Key Outcomes

Over 18 months, the results were staggering:

- **Revenue Growth**: From $0 to **$2.2 million**
- **Profit Margin**: Approximately **30%**
- **Conversion Rates**: Improved lead conversion rates significantly through responsive communication and effective follow-ups.

These metrics highlight the power of a well-structured digital marketing strategy in transforming a startup’s fortunes.

## The Step-by-Step Approach to Digital Marketing Success

### 1. High Intent First - Google Ads

Initially, we focused on Google Ads to target high-intent customers actively searching for roofing services. This approach ensured we were reaching potential clients who were already looking for solutions. 

- **Landing Pages**: Developed multiple landing pages optimized for specific search terms, incorporating dynamic text based on user searches.
- **A/B Testing**: Continuously tested different variations to optimize conversion rates, achieving an impressive **21% conversion rate**.

### 2. Fixing the Response Gap

Timely responses are critical in the home services industry. Early on, I took on the responsibility of answering inbound leads, ensuring every call was addressed promptly. 

- **Call Center Transition**: After a few months, I encouraged the client to hire a call center to handle incoming calls, which improved response times but was still lacking in effectiveness compared to an in-house team.

### 3. Feeding the Algorithm

With increased lead flow came the opportunity to refine our ad targeting further.

- **Data Integration**: I guided the client in linking their CRM data to our ad campaigns, allowing us to feed valuable insights back into Google Ads and Meta Ads for improved targeting and performance.

### 4. Expanding with Meta Ads

As Google Ads began reaching its limits in terms of lead volume, we turned to Meta Ads for broader audience engagement.

- **Creative Testing**: By analyzing successful roofing ads, I developed a library of creative ideas that informed our Meta Ads strategy, resulting in increased lead generation.

### 5. Building Trust and Authority

Establishing a reputable online presence is crucial for conversion.

- **Review Management**: Implemented systems for gathering Google reviews to enhance local reputation.
- **Content Creation**: Encouraged the client to film job site content, boosting engagement and trust across social media channels.

## Future Growth and Rethinking Agency Models

Despite the impressive revenue, I had to evaluate whether my efforts were worth the return. With only **$52.5k** in earnings, I found myself questioning the sustainability of the agency model. 

- **Sales Conversion Bottleneck**: The key to future profitability lies in improving the sales conversion rates, especially for higher-ticket projects. To address this, I recommended hiring an experienced roofing sales consultant to optimize their sales process.

## Conclusion: Is This Model Sustainable?

The journey from $0 to $2.2 million was not just a testament to effective digital marketing strategies but also a learning experience. While the metrics look great on paper—*14x return on ad spend, $4.2 in profit for every $1 spent*—the reality of the profit margin made me rethink my pricing strategy and service offerings.
