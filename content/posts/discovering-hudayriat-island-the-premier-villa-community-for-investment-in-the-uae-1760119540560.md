If you're in the market for real estate investment in the UAE, you might have heard whispers of Hudayriat Island, particularly the exclusive Nawayef Hills community. In an ever-evolving real estate landscape, discerning buyers are looking for unique opportunities that promise not only luxury living but also excellent returns on investment. With its unparalleled features and growing demand, Hudayriat Island stands as an exceptional choice for high-end clients seeking a property that ticks every box. 

## The Unique Selling Proposition of Hudayriat Island

Hudayriat Island is not just another project in the UAE; it’s a rare gem. Located on hills that rise 50 to 60 meters above sea level, this community offers unobstructed sea views and skyline vistas that are unmatched in the region. Unlike Palm Jebel Ali or any other developments, the Nawayef Hills community is the only villa community on an island, making it a unique investment opportunity.

### Supply and Demand Dynamics

Recent reports indicate that Hudayriat Island will see the lowest supply of any island in Abu Dhabi over the next three years, with just 872 units available—including villas, townhouses, and apartments. Despite this limited supply, the area has experienced significant transactions, with AED 2.7 billion worth of transactions in 2024 and AED 3.5 billion in the first half of 2025 alone. This speaks volumes about the demand for Hudayriat Island properties.

## Nawayef Hills: An Investment Worth Considering

Within Hudayriat Island, Nawayef Hills presents an exclusive opportunity for investors. Currently, only 7-8 villas are available, with prices starting at AED 10.3 million. These properties boast massive plots of 8,000-9,000 sqft and built-up areas (BUA) of at least 5,000 sqft. The price per square foot is competitive compared to established communities such as Saadiyat Beach Villas, which currently range from AED 2,900 to AED 3,000 per sqft.

### Amenities and Lifestyle

One of the most attractive features of Hudayriat Island is its comprehensive amenity offerings. Unlike older communities with limited facilities, Hudayriat Island boasts:

- Glamping resorts
- Schools
- Retail malls
- Clinics
- Parks and beaches
- Community centers
- Sports courts
- Cycling and running tracks
- An Olympic velodrome

These amenities ensure that residents have everything they need within reach, enhancing both lifestyle and property value.

## Flexible Payment Plans 

Another significant attraction for potential buyers is the exceptional payment plan offered by the government developer, Modon. A 40/60 payment plan with only a 10% down payment is unprecedented for such an exclusive product. This flexibility allows investors to secure a luxury villa without a hefty upfront cost, making it easier to enter this booming market.

### Current Market Trends 

Investors who purchased properties in Nawayef Hills at earlier launch prices of AED 7 million have already seen substantial premiums of AED 500,000 to AED 1 million on their investments. As demand continues to rise, this trend is likely to persist, making now an opportune time for investment.

## Why Choose Hudayriat Island Over Other Areas?

When considering the best areas to live in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Hudayriat Island uniquely positions itself with several advantages:

- **Proximity to Downtown**: Just 10-15 minutes to Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), the financial hub of Abu Dhabi.
- **Luxurious Living**: Nestled among some of the UAE's most affluent neighborhoods, including Bateen, which is comparable to Belgravia in London.
- **Competitive Pricing**: Offering large layouts at a lower price per square foot compared to established communities, ensuring value for money.
